        A multidisciplinary designer in Atlanta, GA. I love solving complex user problems in ways that make you say "of course!". I've worked on both consumer and enterprise-level products, with screen sizes ranging from the very large to those that fit on your wrist. I'm equally comfortable with pen/paper, flow/story mapping, designing in Sketch, prototyping, or heads down in HTML/CSS.

        I'm currently a UX team lead at <strong>CareerBuilder</strong>.
